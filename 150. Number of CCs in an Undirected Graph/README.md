150. Number of Connected Components in Undirected Graph

There is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array, where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

Return the total number of connected components in that graph

Approach:
1. Adj List
2. DFS
